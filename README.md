'How many batteries need to be installed, to handle more renewables on the grid?'

An optimization script to solve this problem.

Optimization ends when either:

1. No more renewable energy produced, is wasted.
2. Renewables and batteries can supply 100% of gridload.
3. Cost limit is reached (if set).

All the modifiable parameters used in the program are stored as variables in config.py.
